                  Change log for XFITSview

Version 0.1: Initial public (beta) release.

Version 0.2: Use more general Motif routines; fix bug in option box
with images with only two axes. 

Version 0.3: Fix bug in postion marking routines which could crash the
program.  Dialog box is now not deleted after marking a position.
Movie would not restart unless stop button was pressed; also fixed
several problems with stopping the movie.
Cleaned up several potential problems.

Version 0.4: Handle Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) notion of coordinates.

Version 0.5: Allow user selection of the coordinate Equinox for
displayed and entered positions.  Given a celestial position, look up
the appropriate file in a directory index and load the image.

Version 1.0: Copy the currently displayed image into a specified file.
Widen search for peak pixel around specified position when fitting
positions. 

Version 1.1: Fix bug in setting image plane in fitting position.
Also several bugs causing XFITSview to blow up.  Convert dss  header
info into wcs in the values displayed as "source info".

Version 1.2: Increased display to use 128 colors.  Added histogram
equalization option and made the default pixel range smarter (depends
on the pixel histogram).  Improved on line help system.
   Modified to use IRAF CD matrix coordinates. Now sub pixel "precision"
in positions is obtained using left button clicks on a zoomed image.
  Fix bug in converting dss to wcs for display; the sign
of the RA pixel increment was wrong.  Also fixed a bug in the dss 
coordinate routines that could give a 180 deg. error in the position
if the PSS plate included a celestial pole.

Version 1.2.1: Fixed bug in precessing coordinated in looking up a
FITS file from the index file. 

Version 1.3: Now works on more types of displays, especially the 
linux 24 bit color displays.

Version 1.3.1:
Loading a new movie frame was screwing up the scrolling, fixed.
Preview now can cope with FITS headers with LF/CR characters.
Movie box now gives correct position on 3rd axis, was off by one pixel.
Info box now only multiplies RA increments by 3600 on the strings 
"RA  " and "RA--".

Version 1.3.2
Added support for images using the CD matrix coordinates but not from 
IRAF.  Movie now runs continiously.

Version 1.3.3
Now accepts pixel values to mark in addition to celestial coordinates.

Version 1.3.4
Fix problem that caused crashed with LessTif; some dialogs now hidden rather 
than destroyed and recreated.  Also do more checking for bad pointers.

Version 2.0: 06 June 2005 distribute with autoconfig/configure scripts to build

Version 2.1: June 2006 imagedisp:FitPos trap wild fits

Version 2.2  Aug 2007: Trap failures in pfit and do simpler momemt fit

Version 3.0 22 Feb 2017: move to git repository on GitHub
