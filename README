   XFITSview is a viewer for FITS format images for unix/X-Windows
systems.  XFITSview will display images allowing zooming, scrolling,
modifying the brightness, contrast and color and allow determination
of celestial positions in the image.  Positions and brightnesses of
selected pixels may be logged to a text file.  Specified positions in
the image may be marked.  Images may be compared by "blinking" them
and 3 dimensional images may be viewed in the form of a movie.  The
program contains extensive online documentation.  Blanked pixels and
all defined FITS image data types are supported.  Normal or gzip
compressed files may be used.

 Installation
 ------------
   
    Installation of XFITSview requires an ansi c compiler and the
Motif package of software for the X-Windows system (not included in
this distribution).  If Motif is not available on your system, LessTif
is a freeware alternative (ftp://ftp.hungry.com/pub/hungry/lesstif/).
You must install Motif (and X-windows) before installing XFITSview.
To install:

gtar xzvf xfitsview??.tgz
cd XFITSview
./configure
make

and this should build the executable XFITSview.  Move this to somewhere 
in your path ($PATH).  If this procedure doesn't work, the most likely reason 
is that the MOTIF directories weren't located. If the libraries are in a
nonstandard place then you must tell configure must tell with command line 
options:
  --with-motif=DIR        search for MOTIF in DIR/include and DIR/lib
  --with-motif-includes=DIR

Some influential environment variables for configure:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  CPPFLAGS    C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if you have
              headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CPP         C preprocessor

Usage
-----

   XFITSview may be started with the name of a FITS format file as a
command line argument.  Either the initial or subsequent files may be
selected using the "Open" item in the "File" menu.  Consult the "Help
Me" item in the "Help" menu for further details.  Each menu column has
a separate help item.
